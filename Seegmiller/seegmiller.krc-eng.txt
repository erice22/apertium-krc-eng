*Drop *by *drop but *lake *is *formed.
*Where *there *is *no *unity, *there *is *no *happiness.
*In *unity *there *is *strength.
But *rabbit *today *is *better *than but *deer *tomorrow.
But *rabbit *in *the *hand *is *better *than but *deer #ten *the *steppe.
*The *experienced *one *is *not *the *one *who *has *lived *long, the leg *the *one *who *has *seen *much.
*The *mattresses *lie *in *piles. *Those *who *don'*t *know *them *are *donkeys.
*In but *dark *shed, but *raging *puppy.
*Its *exterior *is *black, *its *interior *is *red.
*It *is *born *in *the *water *and *lives #ten *the *land; *when *it *see *its *mother, *it *dies.
*Its *head *is *empty; *its *bottom *is *empty; *its *middle *is *fire *and *water.
*We *look the name *it; *it *looks the name *the *sky.
*Don'*t *promise, the leg *if *you *promise, *don'*t *turn *back.
*Rushing *water *never *reaches *the *sea.
*The *sun *emerging *from *the *clouds *heats *strongly
But *fireless *chimney *emits *no *smoke.
*In but *young *stomach, but *stone *is *digested.
*The *beautiful *one *is *not *beautiful, *the *one *you *love *is *beautiful.
*The *candle *of *the *poor *burns *gloomily.
*It *has *meat the leg *no *blood; *it *has *skin the leg *no *bones.
*Over *the *top *of *the *house, but *colorful *blanket.
*Without but *foot *and *without but *hand, *it *opens *the *door.
*The *rays *of *the *bright *sun *light *up *the *heights *of *the *tall *mountains; *the *broad *valley *of *the *Teberdi *awoke *from *its *night'*s *sleep.
*The *sun, *illluminating *everything, *slowly *descends *from *the *steep *mountains.
*The *morning *air *brings *the *scent *of *pitch *from *the *pine *forests.
*The *River *Teberdi, *its *currents *ringing, *rushes *down *through *the *gorge.
*Although *it *is *summer, *the *morning *coolness *of *the *river *forces *people *to *dress *warmly.
