Drop by drop a lake is formed.
Where there is no unity, there is no happiness.
In unity there is strength.
A rabbit today is better than a deer tomorrow.
A rabbit in the hand is better than a deer on the steppe.
The experienced one is not the one who has lived long, but the one who has seen much.
The mattresses lie in piles. Those who don't know them are donkeys.
In a dark shed, a raging puppy.
Its exterior is black, its interior is red.
It is born in the water and lives on the land; when it see its mother, it dies.
Its head is empty; its bottom is empty; its middle is fire and water.
We look at it; it looks at the sky.
Don't promise, but if you promise, don't turn back.
Rushing water never reaches the sea.
The sun emerging from the clouds heats strongly
A fireless chimney emits no smoke.
In a young stomach, a stone is digested.
The beautiful one is not beautiful, the one you love is beautiful.
The candle of the poor burns gloomily.
It has meat but no blood; it has skin but no bones.
Over the top of the house, a colorful blanket.
Without a foot and without a hand, it opens the door.
The rays of the bright sun light up the heights of the tall mountains; the broad valley of the Teberdi awoke from its night's sleep.
The sun, illluminating everything, slowly descends from the steep mountains.
The morning air brings the scent of pitch from the pine forests.
The River Teberdi, its currents ringing, rushes down through the gorge.
Although it is summer, the morning coolness of the river forces people to dress warmly.
