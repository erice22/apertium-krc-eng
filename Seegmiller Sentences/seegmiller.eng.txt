The one who falls into the same hole twice is blind; the one who cheats on the same person twice is a fool.
Drop by drop a lake is formed.
Where there is no unity, there is no happiness.
In unity there is strength.
A rabbit today is better than a deer tomorrow.
A rabbit in the hand is better than a deer on the steppe.
The experienced one is not the one who has lived long, but the one who has seen much.
The mattresses lie in piles. Those who don't know them are donkeys.
In a dark shed, a raging puppy.
Its exterior is black, its interior is red.
It is born in the water and lives on the land; when it see its mother, it dies.
Its head is empty; its bottom is empty; its middle is fire and water.
We look at it; it looks at the sky.
Don't promise, but if you promise, don't turn back.
